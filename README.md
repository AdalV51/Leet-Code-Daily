# Daily LeetCode Challenge Solutions 🧠💻

This repository is a personal endeavor to sharpen my problem-solving skills by taking on the daily LeetCode challenge. Each day, a new problem is solved and the solution is uploaded here.

## What is LeetCode? 🤔

LeetCode is a platform for learning and improving coding skills with a focus on preparing for technical coding interviews. They offer a feature called "Daily Question," which is a random problem selected each day for users to solve.

## Repository Structure 📁

Each directory within this repository corresponds to a specific challenge, organized inside the `questions` directory by the date on which it was completed. The naming convention is `YYYY-MM-DD_Title-of-Challenge`.

/questions/2023-11-09_Count-Number-of-Homogenous-Substrings
- solution.py
- README.md

/questions/2023-11-10_Restore-the-Array-From-Adjacent-Pairs
- solution.py
- README.md

## Languages 🌐

Solutions are primarily written in Python 🐍. Occasionally, solutions in other languages may be included to showcase different approaches or to practice with that particular language.
